### Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to
 * Explain the snow mass and energy balance over a snowpack
 * Read, modify, and write computer programs to analyze snow-related data
 * Apply data analysis techniques to understand real world problems related to snow
 * Perform original analysis of snow field measurements


> ### Guiding principles for this quarter
> 
> **We want to emphasize in person, experiential learning.**
>   * We will have labs and field trips on campus that cannot be done remotely.
>   * If something comes up so that you cannot attend class, please reach out to the professor as soon as possible.
>
> **We’re all in this together**
>  * If you do need to miss one week, you can best make up the material by meeting up with someone else in the class.
>  * Please reach out to your fellow students and make plans to watch out for each other.

### Office Hours

3-4pm Tuesday/Thursday or by appointment

```note
The UW eScience institute offers [data science office hours](https://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/) which could be useful for your projects or your own research work.
```

### Textbooks

## Logistics and Grading

### Computing Resources

For lab activities and assignments, we will be using a [JupyterHub](https://spestana.github.io/data-analysis/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html) computing environment, and programming with [python](https://spestana.github.io/data-analysis/resources/a-learning-python.html). 

If you need access to a laptop computer (such as if yours breaks) you may check one out from the [Student Technology Loan Program](https://stlp.uw.edu/). Please contact me if you need help accessing a computer reliably.


### Lectures and labs

The first 50 minutes of each class period is reserved for lectures and associated discussions. Lecture slides will be available on Canvas, along with any additional files for reading.


### Labs
After a 10 minute break, 50 minutes of class will involve working on python labs.
Lab content (jupyter notebooks and data files) can be downloaded directly from the class website. ([GitHub Option](https://spestana.github.io/data-analysis/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub))

We will use classroom space and Slack to work in small groups on lab exercises. If you are not able to attend the lab in person, please reach out to others in the class for collaborative support. Contact the instructor or TA to be added to the Slack workspace.


### Homework Assignments

Homework assignments will be given out on Thursdays at the beginning of class, and will be **due the following week on Thursday at the beginning of class (10:30 am, Pacific Time)**. 
Homework questions are posted on the class website along with links to any data files you might need.

You are encouraged to work together on homeworks and collaborate, but you must turn in your own assignments with your own work. 

Make sure that your name and the assignment number are at the top of your notebook file in markdown text. **Your answers should be clearly labeled and written in markdown cells of the notebook. **

Submit your completed homework assignments via Canvas by uploading:
* Your original .ipynb jupyter notebook file(s)
  * To download your notebook file, right click on the file in the navigation pane on JupyterHub, then click *Download*
* A PDF copy of the jupyter notebook file(s)
  * To save your notebook as a PDF, go to *File* > *Export Notebook As...* > *Export Notebook to PDF*, this will download a PDF file copy of your notebook to your personal computer which you can upload to Canvas

Homework will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Homework handed in late will be accepted up to (but not later than) the following Tuesday at the beginning of class (10:30am), but two grade points will be deducted from the grade for late assignments (i.e. a late assignment that would receive a 10 if handed in on time will be assigned a grade of 8). Everyone's lowest scoring homework assignment will be dropped, so please do not worry if one week is not going your way.

### Final Project

Final projects will be completed in pairs (or individually on request), and the topic will be selected by the students in consultation with the instructor. 
The topic should involve analyzing field measurements to answer a snow-hydrology related question.
Updates on the project are required as part of the 2nd, 5th, and 7th homework assignments. 
During the final week of class, students will present their research project results to the class.
The project will be graded on the basis of the presentation (20%) and on the report (80%), which should be less than 10 pages long. Final reports will be due on the final day of class, **March 13 2025, by 11:59pm**. Further details are provided on the [Course Project page](b-project.html).

### Grading Policy

* **Class Attendance and Participation: 5%**
  * Participation includes discussions in class and providing feedback on student presentations
* **Homework assignments: 65%**
  * Each of the 8 homework assignments are worth 10 points (for a total of 80 points), however your lowest assignment will be dropped, and the overall homework grade will be evaluated out of 7 assignments and 70 points total.
* **Final Project: 30%**
  * See the [CEWA 565 course project page](/overview/b-project.html) for grading rubric.


## Schedule

The schedule is subject to change and will be posted during the first week of class.

### Conduct

The University takes academic integrity very seriously. Behaving with integrity is part of our responsibility to our shared learning community. One example of misconduct I have observed in this particular class in the past is plagiarism (representing the work of others as your own without giving appropriate credit to the original author(s)). **If you’re uncertain about if something is academic misconduct, ask me. I am willing to discuss questions you might have.**

[Community Standards & Student Conduct](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/)

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable as they pursue their academic goals. Allegations of misconduct by students may be referred to the appropriate campus office for investigation and resolution. More information can be found online at [https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/](https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/)


### Access and Accommodations

If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.

DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions.  Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DRS.  It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.


### Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities.
