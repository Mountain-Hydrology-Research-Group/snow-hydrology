# Course Project: CEWA 568

The goal of the course project is to give you hands on explaining and teaching topics of particular interest to you, as well as experience writing about and presenting data and snow hydrology information. Project will consist of an oral presentation (20% of total) and a written report (80% of total), which will be no longer than 10 pages (for a group of two; or 15 for a group of three), including figures.

```note
**Sources of help:**

UW has services to help people with [statistics](https://www.stat.washington.edu/consulting/) and [data analysis](http://escience.washington.edu/dss-hours). These are designed primarily to help graduate students engaged in research (not with homework), but presuming your course project is related to a research interest of yours, they have been very helpful in the past.

## Potential project ideas...

You are welcome to use your own data and answer a question of interest to you and relevant to your own research – please let the instructor know as early as possible so that we can make sure you have sufficient data to be successful. Alternatively, you may choose one of the projects below. 

1. **How does weather vary in a high-elevation valley in Colorado?**  The U.S. Department of Energy and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration have been measuring a lot in the East River Basin of Colorado, as part of the [SAIL and SPLASH](https://www.arm.gov/news/features/post/81524) campaigns.  The data is publicly available for both [SAIL](https://adc.arm.gov/discovery/#/results/s:guc/site) and [SPLASH](https://psl.noaa.gov/splash/), and your TA, Danny, can help with questions and processsing code. Talk to Jessica and/or Danny if you want to work on a project using these data.

## Grading Rubic


### Presentation 
(30 points; will account for 20% of project grade)

A powerpoint-type presentation, like you would expect at a conference, 10 minutes in length, with an additional 5 minutes for questions. Your classmates are your audience. Present your question, why it is important, what methods you employed to answer the question, your major results, and the implications of your results. For pairs, both project partners will present together.

* Clarity of Overall Presentation (10 points)
  - Clear statement of the problem
  - Clear explanations of what you did, easy to follow
  - Good transitions from one section to the next
  - Ability to answer questions raised by audience
* Quality of Visual Aids/Graphics (10 points)
  - All graphics easy to see, properly labeled, large enough font
  - Correct limits on plot axes to show relevant information
  - Proper choice of type of graph to convey information
  - Interest level – slides nice/interesting to engage audience
* Technical Analysis and Discussion (10 points)
  - Proper methods applied
  - Accuracy of results
  - Explanation of why results are what they are
  - Ability to relate results to other studies and other presentations in the class


### Written Report
(30 points; will account for 80% of project grade)

For the written report, you must include an abstract (no more than 300 words) and a list of references; these can be in addition to your 10 (for a group of two; or 15 for a group of three) pages.  Follow the same format outlined for the presentation but feel free to include more details (equations, etc.). Please address any questions or comments that were raised during the presentation. Use clear, concise sentences and proper grammar.

* Quality of Writing (10 points)
  - Clear and easy to read 
  - Proper grammar and spelling
  - Clear statement of the problem 
  - Good transitions from one section to the next
  - Clarity of explanations of what you did
* Technical Analysis (10 points)
  - Clearly described methods, proper literature cited
  - Technical difficulty of methods applied
  - Accuracy of results
* Interpretation, Analysis, and Discussion of Result (10 points)
  - Attempted to explain why certain patterns were observed in the data and/or analysis 
  - Thought about results in context of other studies
  - Outlined next steps to be taken
  - Addressed underlying assumptions in the analysis and how these may have affected results
