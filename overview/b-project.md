# Course Project: CEWA 568

The goal of the course project is to give you hands-on experience exploring a snow hydrology topic of particular interest to you. 
The project will consist of an oral presentation (20% of total) and written report (80% of total).

The written report should include a clearly-stated research question, a methods section identifying the data you will use to answer the question, and a results section describing your findings. 
The report should contain at least three references to relevant scientific literature.
The report should be at least 3 pages long (excluding figures and references) and no longer than 10 pages, including figures and references.

## Potential project ideas...

1) Explore variability in the snow surface temperatures measured by multiple instruments at Kettle Ponds.
2) Explore wind speed thresholds for initiation of suspended and blowing snow using wind speed and blowing snow measurements at Kettle Ponds.
3) Examine the snowpack structure and associated avalanche risk using snowpit data from Kettle Ponds.
4) Test the performance of snowpack compaction models using snow pillow and snow depth measurements from Kettle Ponds.
