# 7) Snow melt

![snowmelt sequence](../modules/data/KPsnowmelt_2023.png)

# Background

All good things, like the seasonal snowpack, must end.  
The 2022-2023 snowpack at Kettle Ponds, though eternal in our minds, did indeed melt away.  
In this module, we examine Kettle Ponds field measurements.
We examine the snowpack ripening process using in-snow thermistors and
the initiation of melt and percolation of melt water using snow surface temperatures and soil moisture sensors.

Melting season is accompanied by wet snow metamorphism (which we covered in an early lecture). If you want to re-learn about wet snow metamorphism, check out [Matthew Sturm's lecture on the matter](https://youtu.be/tg2v1DC5Nrk?si=w28f1lgThRipCR7H&t=3096)
Make sure to check out slush flows and wet snow mysteries at 1 hour 20 minutes and 20 seconds.
