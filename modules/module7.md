# 7) Snow melt

![snowmelt sequence](../modules/data/KPsnowmelt_2023.png)

# Background

All good things, like the seasonal snowpack, must end.  
The 2022-2023 snowpack at Kettle Ponds, though eternal in our minds, did indeed melt away.  
In this module, we examine Kettle Ponds field measurements.
We examine the snowpack ripening process using in-snow thermistors and
the initiation of melt and percolation of melt water using snow surface temperatures and soil moisture sensors.

Melting season is accompanied by wet snow metamorphism (which we covered in an early lecture). If you want to re-learn about wet snow metamorphism, check out [Matthew Sturm's lecture on the matter](https://youtu.be/tg2v1DC5Nrk?si=w28f1lgThRipCR7H&t=3096).
Make sure to check out slush flows and wet snow mysteries at 1 hour 20 minutes and 20 seconds.

## Homework 7
On Tuesday February 25th, we will hold a discussion on one of the papers listed below. 
Please review the abstracts of the two papers and decide which paper you prefer to read - we will collectively decide on a paper in class on Thursday February 20th.

(Painter et al., 2012, Dust radiative forcing in snow of the Upper Colorado River Basin:  1. A 6 year record of energy balance, radiation, and dust concentrations)[https://agupubs.
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR011985]

(Brandt et al., 2022, A Review of the Hydrologic Response Mechanisms During Mountain Rain-on-Snow)[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.791760/full]

The homework assignments for modules 7 and 8 are lumped together. See Module 8 for your homework assignment, Due March 6th.
