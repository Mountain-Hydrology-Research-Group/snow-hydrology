# 5) Temperatures above, below, and within the snow

Data visualization (Note, this was developed with air temperature data but may be helpful with visualizing our snow data):
- [Interactive Plots](lab5/interactive-plots.ipynb) with [iButtons_2008-2010.mat](data/iButtons_2008-2010.mat)
- [Warming Stripes Figure](lab5/warming-stripes.ipynb)

## Lab 5: Plotting temperatures around the snow.

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub).

* [Lab 5-1: Gradients and the heat equation](lab5/lab5-1.ipynb)
* [Lab 5-2: Autocorrelation](lab5/lab5-2.ipynb) with [iButtons_2008-2010.mat](data/iButtons_2008-2010.mat)
