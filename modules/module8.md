# 8) What makes snow melt?

![snowmelt sequence](data/KPsnowmelt_2023.png)

# Background

All good things, like this class and the seasonal snowpack, have to come to an end.  With this final module, we will investigate how all of our snow melts away, and how sublimation changes to evaporation and melt.  I will insert the mass balance and energy balance equations here with some references soon.

## Lab 8:

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub).

* [Lab 8-1: Ripe snowpack, Energy balance, and Melt rates.](lab8/lab8-1.ipynb)
  
* [Lab 8-2: Timeseries Lab](lab8/lab8-2.ipynb)
  * data: [waterlevel.mat](data/waterlevel.mat)
  * Okay, I have not deleted this yet because I'm tempted to run Fourier transforms on our turbulence data...

### Homework 8, Problem 1: Energy for melt and melt rates
Using the data collected, as presented in Lab 8-1, calculate (a) the total daily energy balance, (b) the total daily change in snow temperature, (c) the total daily vertical water vapor flux, and (d) the total daily snow melt for the period from April 1 to May 15.  Do our data suggest that the mass and energy budgets work?  If not, what do you think are the primary sources of our errors.  



 
### Homework 8, Problem 2: Timeseries Analysis
 
**PLACEHOLDER** -- we might transform turbulence data here.  Following lab 8-2, use Fourier Analysis to determine the dominant frequencies and periods of oscilliation of the water level data provided (waterlevel.mat).  Based on what you find, where (in what type of environment) do you think this water level was measured?
