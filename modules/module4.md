# 4) Mass Balance:  Blowing snow and how snow smoothes landscapes

# Background

[![Watch a video of Ethan Gutmann explaining how scanning lidars can detect both snow depth and blowing snow](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-9Mt2mrmAy8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Mt2mrmAy8)

Read this article by Charles Parr, Matthew Sturm and Chris Larsen about [Arctic Snowdrift Patterns](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027823).

## Lab 4: Wind Speed and Particle Flux

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub).

* Data: TBD
* [Lab 4-1: Plotting wind speed](lab4/lab4-1.ipynb)
* [Lab 4-2: Comparing wind speed with snow particle fluxes](lab4/lab4-2.ipynb)

## Homework 4

### Problem 1, based on combining material in Labs 2 & 3 and Modules 2 & 3

In Lab 2 and Module 2, we saw that in late December, one of the three snow pillows had a sudden increase in snow water equivalent while the other three had a decrease.  Look at the snow depths, wind speeds, and snow particle fluxes during this period.  Create plots to explain what is happening here. 

### Problem 2: Testing wind thresholds and particle counts

 




### Problem 3: Project

Please give a brief update of where you are with your project.  At this poing you should have acquired data that you can plot.  Include one example plot of the data in this homework.  Let us know if you have any questions or concerns at this point.
