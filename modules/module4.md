# 4) Mass Balance:  Blowing snow, wind, and how snow smoothes landscapes

# Background

[![Watch a video of Ethan Gutmann explaining how scanning lidars can detect both snow depth and blowing snow](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-9Mt2mrmAy8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Mt2mrmAy8)
In the video above, Ethan explains how the scanning lidars work, while Jessica looks at the lidar equipment.

## Homework 4

### Problem 1, based on combining material in Labs 2 & 3 and Modules 2 & 3

In Lab 2 and Module 2, we saw that in late December, one of the four snow pillows had a sudden increase in snow water equivalent while the other three had a decrease.  In Lab 3, we saw a similar pattern in the snow depth measurements near of the snow pillows.  Look at the snow depths, the snow densities, wind speeds, and snow particle fluxes during this period.  Create plots to help explain what is happening here. Referencing your plots, explain what happened in Kettle Ponds during this period.

### Problem 2: Testing wind thresholds and particle counts

There is a threshold wind speed that must be exceeded for snow transport.  [Li and Pomeroy 1997](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1997)036<0205:EOTWSF>2.0.CO;2) state that 10-m wind speeds must exceed about 7.7 m/s for dry snow transport and about 9.9 m/s for wet snow transport.  Use the 10-m wind speed measurements and particle counters to test if these thresholds match the observations at Kettle Ponds.  If you have time, further discuss the questions at the end of Lab 4-2.


### Problem 3: Project

Please give a brief update of where you are with your project.  At this point you should have acquired data that you can plot.  Include one example plot of the data in this homework.  Let us know if you have any questions or concerns at this point.
