# 6) Temperatures above, below, and within the snow

Data visualization (Note, this was developed with air temperature data but may be helpful with visualizing our snow data):
- [Interactive Plots](lab5/interactive-plots.ipynb) with [iButtons_2008-2010.mat](data/iButtons_2008-2010.mat)
- [Warming Stripes Figure](lab5/warming-stripes.ipynb)

# Background
![Here are February temperatures at Kettle Ponds](data/SoSFebtemps.png)

* For an overview of mountain temperatures and lapse rates, check out Jessica's seminar on [How cold is it in the mountains](https://youtu.be/saUe3uIegRs) 

```note
## Lab 6: Plotting temperatures around the snow.

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub).
