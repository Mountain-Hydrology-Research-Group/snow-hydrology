# 2) Mass Balance:  How much snow is there?

# Background

For many regions, mountain snow provides much of society's water.  The weight of snow is due almost entirely to its water content.  Therefore, one of the main instruments of snow hydrology is similar to giant scale similar to the one you might find in your bathroom.  [insert snow pillow video here]

## Lab 2: Mass Balance

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub).

* Data: [Daily Precipitation at Kettle Ponds](data/KPprecip.dat) 
* [Lab 2-1: Downloading and plotting data from a Snotel station](lab2/lab2-1.ipynb)
* [Lab 2-2: Downloading and plotting data from the Kettle Ponds snow pillows and one temperature sensor](lab2/lab2-2.ipynb)

```



## Homework 2

### Problem 1

Using the [observations of total precipitation](data/KPprecip.dat), and the snow pillow data, we are going to investigate mass balance and snow accumulation at Kettle Ponds.

A. Plot a timeseries of total accumulated precipitation and total accumulated snow water equivalent from the four snow pillows.  Discuss how they match and how they differ, and why you think they differ.


### Problem 2: Course Project Selection

Write a brief paragraph (3-9 sentences) describing your term project. Include the name of your partner (or specify you will be doing the project alone), the concept you will communicate or teach, and the tools you will use. **If you have questions about the project, now is the time to talk to the instructor.**
