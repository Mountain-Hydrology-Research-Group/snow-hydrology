# 2) Measurement Strategies, Basics of the Snowpack Mass and Energy Balances, and Snowpack Dynamics 

# Background

For many regions, mountain snow provides much of society's water.  The weight of snow is due almost entirely to its water content.  Therefore, one of the main instruments of snow hydrology is a giant scale similar to the one you might find in your bathroom.  In the video below, we are installing a fluidless snow pillow in the East River Basin at Kettle Ponds.  Many snow pillows are filled with fluid and measure the pressure on the fluid from the weight of the snow.  In the Western U.S., networks of snow pillows are maintained by the [National Resource Conservations Service,NRCS](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/quicklinks/imap) and the [California Department of Water Resources](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/).

Click on the photo above to see a short Youtube video of a snow pillow being installed.  Look at the map below to see where these snow pillows are located relative to the meteorological towers at Kettle Ponds.

![Here is a map of where the Kettle Ponds pillows are located](data/KettlePondsPillowlidarmap.png)

Above, we see an aerial photo, with each tower and corresponding snow pillow labeled.  We also see a lidar map of snow depth, with the snow pillow locations shown with circles, and a webcam photo taken from the downwind tower towards the central and upwind towers. This map will be useful in the lab and homework below, and in future modules.

## Lab 2: Mass Balance

In Lab 2, we will look at data from SNOTEL stations and the Kettle Ponds field site, in the Upper East River Valley. 

We will download SNOTEL data and use pre-downloaded SOS data. 

Working through labs 2-1 and 2-2 will prepare you to complete Homework 2. 



## Homework 2

### Problem 1

Using the observations of precipitation and the snow pillow data at Kettle Ponds and the two SNOTEL stations (see Module 2 labs), we are going to investigate the mass balance and snow accumulation at sites in the East River Valley.

A. Plot a timeseries of total accumulated precipitation and total accumulated snow water equivalent from the four snow pillows.  Add to your plot timeseries from the two Snotel Stations located nearby.  Discuss how they match and how they differ, and why you think they differ.

B. Write out the snow mass balance equation from lecture.  Discuss, given the data you have plotted, what aspects of the mass balance equation do you have the most certainty about?  The least certainty?

C. Discuss which factors of the mass balance are likely to be the most similar spatially?  Which differ the most across different locations?  Is there more variability between sites further away?  Or are the four snow pillows at Kettle Ponds as different as the two sites near the watershed?

D. Researchers at the Rocky Mountain National Biological Lab in the Upper East River Valley want to start their research as soon as possible. To access the lab, they need to drive down a forest service road that is currently snowed in.  The forest service opens the road when the snow melts and disappears. Using the long term records at the SNOTEL sites, and any other information you like, make a prediction about whether the snow will be gone (and hence the road clear) by 1 June 2025.

E. Using snow depth and SWE measurements from the snotel sites and Kettle Ponds (select one of the towers from Kettle Ponds), calculate the snow density at each site and plot the distribution (histogram) of snow density values throughout the entire 2022-2023 winter season. Plot a separate distribution for each site and only use data from between December 1 2022 and May 10 2023. Also plot, for each site, a time series of the snow density values. Comment on the believability of the snow density estimate from each site. Also comment on which time of year appears to the best for "powder hounds" - skiiers looking for light, fluffy snow. 


### Problem 2: Course Project Selection

Write a brief paragraph (3-9 sentences) describing your term project. If you would like to work with a partner, include the name of your partner, or specify you will be doing the project alone.  Describe the concept you want to explore and the measurements (dataset) you want to use. **If you have questions about the project, now is the time to talk to the instructor.**
