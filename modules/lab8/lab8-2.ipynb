    "\n",
    "From the documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "> openAMUNDSEN is a fully distributed model, designed primarily for resolving the mass and energy balance of snow and ice covered surfaces in mountain regions. Typically, it is applied in areas ranging from the point scale to the regional scale (i.e., up to some hundreds to thousands of square kilometers), using a spatial resolution of 10–100 m and a temporal resolution of 1–3 h, however its potential applications are very versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the model here http://doc.openamundsen.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the model the entire upper East River Basin. We provide as inputs precipitation and meteorological (air temp, $SW_{in}$, etc) conditions measured at Kettle Ponds as well a 50-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the upper East River Basin."
