# 3) How does a snowpack change?

# Background
[SLF Website on Snow Metamorphism](https://www.slf.ch/en/snow/snow-as-a-material/snow-metamorphism.html)
In [A Field Guide to Snow](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Snow-Snowy-Owl/dp/1602234140/), read Chapter 4 on how to dig and interpret data from a snow pit, and read Chapter 5 on snow metamorphism.
To hear Matthew Sturm explain the concepts in these chapters, check out his [class lecture on snow metamorphism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg2v1DC5Nrk&list=PLPG5Ed5L1SY4RpFe-55WAlFZ58-TwwrWw&index=5).

## Lab 3: How does a snowpack change?

For our lab, we are going to look at one of the easier-to-observe processes of a changing snowpack:  compaction.  To do this, we will use the Kettle Ponds snow pillow data from Lab 2 and combine it with lidar-derived snow depth data at the same locations.  (For a link to a video explaining how the lidar instruments work, see the background section on Module 4.)

Download the lab and data files to your computer. Then, upload them to your JupyterHub [following the instructions here](/resources/b-learning-jupyter.html#working-with-files-on-our-jupyterhub).

## Homework 3: 
(Note:  We will be using the lab material above in Homework 4; for this week's homework, we are focusing on 3-D printing snow and explaining what we see.)

### Problem 1
For this week's homework, use the MakerSpace to create a 3-D printer version of snow.  Explain the characteristics of your snow cube and what physical processes led it to be that way.

Extra Credit:  Give your snow cube to someone and use it to teach them about snow and the evolution of the snowpack.  Report back on what that person thought and how we might explain this better in the future.
