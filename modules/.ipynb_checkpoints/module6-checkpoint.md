# 6) Temperatures above, below, and within the snow

Data visualization (Note, the files below were developed by Steven Pestana for working with air temperature data but may be helpful with visualizing our snow data):
- [Interactive Plots](lab5/interactive-plots.ipynb) with [iButtons_2008-2010.mat](data/iButtons_2008-2010.mat)
- [Warming Stripes Figure](lab5/warming-stripes.ipynb)
